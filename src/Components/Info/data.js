    "Using any smartphone, the veterinarian scans the part of the body to be treated with a video. For good results, the fur is wetted so that it fits tightly. The vet uploads the video to our secure Think3DDD cloud and we process the data into a digital 3D impression. The 3D healing cuff is created and checked by us on the digital 3D impression in close cooperation with the treating veterinarian. The VETorthi is then produced using 3D printing and sent for treatment as quickly as possible.",

The covers are made of very resistant and durable or easily recyclable biologically based materials. The antimicrobial effect lasts for a long time. This protects the environment in the long term. Viruses and bacteria can be killed quickly on the surface of the coatings thanks to nano-copper! Example COVID:30s >60% reduced 5min >90% reduced 1h >99.9% reduced",
